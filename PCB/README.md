## Directories: 

- `/p1`: The 1st prototype, ordered prototypes confirmed NOT working.
- `/p2`: The 2nd prototype, which I produced a batch of 2 prototypes and they worked (see respective readme)
- `/p3`: The 3rd prototype, under active development and NOT YET TESTED.
- `/Plate`: FR4 plate designs.

Any KiCad files in *this specific directory* is under active development and is subject to change. 

### These PCB designs are provided without liability and without any guarantee with regards to functionality. While I have personally tested some of the designs, I do not guarantee that they will work if you were to produce them yourself.
